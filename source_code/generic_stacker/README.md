# Stack and print multiple copies with a easy separation

Tutorial to generate your own models:

- They need to be flat on top and bottom
- Open the stack.scad file using https://www.openscad.org/
- Edit the variables (model thickness, separation, etc)
- Compile the model using F5 to preview until all looks OK
- Render with F6 and export the STL file.

Normally there is NO need for support material.
